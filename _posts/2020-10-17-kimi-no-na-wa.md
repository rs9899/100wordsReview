Inspired by interstellar, this movie has a theme that love as force can break the rules on science.

Trying to keep the spoiler at the lowest, the basis of this movie is that there are 2 teenagers who get
connected through a weird way of communication and through this get to know each other. More like a sci-fi version
of a Long-distance relationship.

The story is great with an excellent background score and cinematography. Though an animation in Japanese, it never feels
like a barrier in the movie experience and will actually tell you a lot about both rural and ritual based side, & urban
fast-paced side of Japan.
