It tells the story of life in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, 
in an area known as the Cidade De Deus, the City of God.

The story is told from the narration of the young photographer. 
Gang wars and criminal activities are at its peak and his path collides
more than often with these overlords. And we get to know them more and
learn that side of the story as well. The realistic portrayal of crimes 
and gang-war makes this movie a gem. 

Many characters involved in the story are in their late teens or early adulthood and that 
makes a very sensitive topic to watch and feel the pain. Because all of this is real as the movie is the narration of a true story.
