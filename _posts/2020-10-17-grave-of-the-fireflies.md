I'm not crying, you are crying.

Based on world-war 2 Japan, this movie tells a story about 2 siblings, an elder brother & baby sister, who are surviving through the war. Times of war are tough and bombing is common. Food is scarce and shelters are all burnt.

This animated movie tries to capture the horrors of war and does not sugar-coat reality. Times are tough and people are mean.
It's a movie that will surely bring tears to your eyes and pain to your heart. But in this pain can we also learn some life lessons.
