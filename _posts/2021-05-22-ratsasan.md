Won't say much about this one. A murder mystery. Wild hunt for solving random murders ongoin in town.
This movie may be inspired by bong joon ho's Memories of Murder. And this is a unique story in the category.

That is all I will say as anything more will crawl into the spoiler category. A must watch. The bigger challenge is to find this movie. Hotstar has it without subs, and there are some dubs on Youtube which are surely illegal.


### Trivia
* ***Ratchasan was ranked at 2 in the IMDb Top Indian Movies of the year 2018.***
