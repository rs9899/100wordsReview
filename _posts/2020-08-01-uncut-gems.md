This movie is just so anxious and chaotic. Still, you will be hooked to the movie. You will feel a headache, still, you wanna know what happens next.
There are multiple converstations ongoing at once making it really tough to focus. The whole cinema seems very grainy adding to the chaos and noise. Still, you
will love the movie.

No idea, how the creators of this movie achieved this feat, but they do and that makes this movie a worth watch.
