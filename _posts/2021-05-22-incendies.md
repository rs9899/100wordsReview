The story of this movie is relatively simple. A story of a sibling who have now moved to a different country, but revisit their country of origin years later. 

Apart from great cinematography, this movie also had a unique story telling style with context switched between past and present. But what makes this story so great and suggested all across by many moviebuffs, I am 
not gonnna tell that either. You have to experience it for yourself. But apart from that thing, this itself is a great movie experience.

Movie is supposed to be this right. A story being shared to the world that we can know about, maybe feel sorry for, and act in some way to make the world a better place. And this movie surely tells a great story.
